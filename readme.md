# Save data manager

If you open the terminal inside `save_data_manager` and run `python3 save_manager.py`, through a UI you can load a Gen5 save file (.sav only) and "send" a Pokémon to the Dream World. This will modify both `save_data/player_data.json` and `save_data/sleeping_pokemon.json`.

# Other Info

Save data will be pulled from the three files in `save_data`, and these can be edited as desired.

Save data that is currently managed by the server:
- Functionality related to Berries. Planting, watering, and harvesting work as expected. Berries will grow over time and their water level will deplete. When harvesting Berries, they will be placed in the player's Treasure Chest, which will be updated on disk as well.
